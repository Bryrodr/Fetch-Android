## Installation

Follow these steps to install and run the project:

1. Open Android Studio.

2. Click on "File" -> "New" -> "Project from Version Control" -> "Git".

3. In the "Git Repository URL" field, enter the following URL: https://github.com/Bryrodr/Fetch-Android.git
4. Click on Clone to start cloning the repository.
5. Build and run the project on an emulator or a physical device.

## Possible Improvements
For the sake of this being a take home test, I did not include these features. In the case of a paid production project, the following would have been done:

- View Model tests
- CI/CD
- Multi Modular Approach
- Splash Screen
- Animations
